## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 2

In this assignment, we were to design two seperate Classes. One is a `Point` class that creates a point that holds an arbitrary number of `dims`. The other was a `Cluster` class that holds an arbitrary number of `Point`s. The `Point`s are managed by implementing a linked list. This is the part of the assignment that I was unable to complete. I understand the concept of a linked list but the syntax, along with using `typedef` was just too much at once to wrap my head around. I am hopeful that as the class continues, that I will gain a better understanding of linked lists and be able to complete our program. 

## Compiler: G++
